    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>My name is <span>Karrie Cheng</span>. I'm studying Computer Science at Texas A&amp;M University and I expect to graduate in Spring 2016. If you're big into the Hackathon scene, catch me at HackTX or TAMUHack this October.</p>
    <p>My goal is to become a <span>software developer</span>. I'll have a comparative advantage in creating financial and statistical software due to my Economics degree and Business Administration minor, but I truly just love solving any type of problem and creating things that help people or make them happy.</p>
    <p>My <span>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</span> and <span>projects</span> can be found here and <a href="projects.html">here</a>.</p>
