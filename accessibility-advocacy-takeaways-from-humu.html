        <h1>Accessibility Advocacy Takeaways from Humu</h1>
        <p>
          Creating products that everyone can use, regardless of ability, is
          simply the moral thing to do. There are many companies that recognize
          this and have a top-down approach to making their products accessible.
          Even then, it can be difficult to achieve complete usability for all
          users. However, when the accessibility approach comes from the bottom
          up, it becomes a matter of will in addition to skill. But it is
          definitely still possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Humu, without even an official accessibility program or leadership,
          we were able to go from having accessibility expressly stated as “not
          being a priority” in October 2021 to having a trained engineering
          team, a wealth of resources, a thriving community, and accessibility
          as a requirement in some of Humu’s latest features by December 2022.
          Here I will be sharing things that we did at Humu to improve usability
          for all and learnings (both framed as advice), particularly from the
          point of view of an individual contributor on the engineering team.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Share knowledge</h2>

        <p>
          In any accessibility effort, you can help your team by setting a
          baseline set of knowledge and by providing them with resources and
          tools to build products that can be truly inclusive.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Set a Baseline</h3>

          <p>
            Before anything, it is important to establish awareness that
            different users have different abilities and that these differences
            can affect the web browsing experience. Without establishing this,
            your team might not understand why you were asking them to do
            certain things (and may not do them as a result). In my experience,
            when a company has no accessibility program, the lack of
            accessibility stems from a lack of disability awareness rather than
            willful neglect. Once they know about an issue, most engineers are
            happy to make changes so the resulting feature can be more
            accommodating.
          </p>
          <p>
            Introducing people to accessibility one by one is not particularly
            efficient, so if there is an avenue for presenting on accessibility,
            take it. You can uniformly set a baseline for accessibility through
            an introductory presentation that covers the above topics in
            addition to how to test, tools for catching usability issues, and
            common ways products can come up short (like the classic
            alt-text/button examples). You can also share the related slides and
            meeting recordings so they can be viewed asynchronously. This is
            what my fellow engineer, Andres Sanchez, and I did in March 2022,
            and then once again in June after we had significantly increased our
            team size.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <details>
              <summary>More notes on frequency</summary>

              I had a set of presentations that I would give on a quarterly
              basis to all front-end engineers at the place I worked prior to
              Humu. The quarterly basis of these presentations meant that any
              engineer would know the expectations for accessibility we had at
              least by their third month at that company. It’s also useful to
              have it as a recurring meeting in case folks have a hard time
              finding time otherwise or would like to ask questions. However,
              this was supposed to be Humu-focused so that’s why this is in the
              footnote
            </details>

        <section>
          <h3>Make Learning Easy</h3>

          <p>
            There are other ways to share information outside of presentations.
            Ultimately, you want to make it as easy as possible to find and
            apply knowledge.
          </p>

          <p>
            At Humu, I created an accessibility drive and training materials and
            referenced some of these materials in widely used documents. For
            example, Humu’s quality assurance (QA) process (known at Humu as
            ‘bug-bashing’) not only contained an explanation on how to bug-bash
            with the screenreader and keyboard but also linked to the longer and
            more in-depth videos. I also included practices that would address
            common accessibility issues in a style guideline document, which is
            something that one of our most tenured engineers, Kat Slump,
            suggested.
          </p>

          <p>
            (Engineering specific) Another place to distribute knowledge is
            directly in the code as comments. Some reusable components need to
            be composed a certain way, and you want to call this out to
            teammates. An example of this would be mentioning that a tooltip
            trigger needs to be a button so non-mouse/trackpad users are able to
            interact with it. Also, you may find that the codebase has 3
            different tooltips, but only one of those tooltips is accessible.
            You could also prefix the inaccessible tooltips’ names with
            ‘deprecated’, and at the top of the files note the reasons why the
            tooltip from a certain library is preferred.
          </p>

          <p>
            (Engineering specific) You can also share knowledge within pull
            request reviews. Sometimes a bit of code may need just an additional
            attribute to make it more perceivable or navigable. When this
            happens, it’s useful to write out the exact change required so that
            the author of the pull request can directly apply this comment.
            Explain why you’re suggesting the change and how it is improving the
            experience for users so the author will remember the suggestion in
            the future. It also saves time and can prevent confusion and
            frustration when the original author does not have the knowledge to
            fix the issue and feels the need to investigate further to correctly
            apply review suggestions as a result.
          </p>

          <ul>
            Tickets can also be a place to call out features that were already
            released that need work, the reasons behind it, and the potential
            approaches for it. This is useful for granular, one-and-done
            tickets. In these tickets, I generally included the following:

            <li>What the desired behavior was</li>

            <li>
              What the current behavior was and how it may have been
              under-serving users
            </li>

            <li>What a potential approach could have been to address it</li>

            <li>
              The particular Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) success
              criterion that had more information on the particular issue
            </li>

            <li>
              A label tagging it as an accessibility (“a11y”) issue so that we
              could easily find all of the accessibility issues
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Create Communities For Learning</h3>

          <p>
            There are a lot of considerations to take into account while
            creating an accessible product, and not all of them were captured in
            the Humu documents. Luckily, we had different places available for
            the team to seek out additional help.
          </p>

          <p>
            Andres Sanchez, the engineer mentioned earlier, created a Slack
            channel dedicated to accessibility which became a key safe place for
            anyone to ask questions or share knowledge in the flow of work. It
            also generally became the hub for us to share resources, interesting
            news, or tools.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also had multiple office hours throughout the week for those who
            might need help with implementing inclusive experiences. This is an
            idea that I got from a former coworker at Hello Alice, Marianne
            Masculino, that worked well at Humu too.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you create enough opportunities and spaces for learning,
            eventually making an inaccessible product becomes harder and harder.
          </p>

          <h3>Share Your Favorite Resources</h3>

          <ul>
            Not all content needs to be custom! For those who are interested in
            learning more about web accessibility beyond our organization’s
            context, I like to share the following resources (which are mostly
            specifications):

            <li>The Google Intro to Accessibility article</li>

            <li>A11ycasts with Rob Dodson</li>

            <li>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) Specification</li>

            <li>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) Specification</li>

        <h2>Share your struggles and strategies</h2>

        <p>
          It was immensely helpful to share my struggles and thoughts with
          managers and peers alike. Doing this can help you understand the best
          way to implement change within your organization. Each time I did this
          at Humu, I received support, insight, or advice without intentionally
          soliciting it. Here are a handful of examples of where this happened
          and how Humu’s products consequently became more accessible.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my first project at Humu, I had been the recipient of the
          disheartening words that every advocate seems to hear: “Accessibility
          is not a priority at this time”. I mentioned this to my first manager,
          Max Berman, who not only (1) gave me hope by correctly predicting that
          it would become more of a priority and that we’d be able to work on it
          more eventually, but (2) also suggested that I could still improve
          accessibility in the meantime by making impactful, low-lift
          improvements. This suggestion allowed me to work in a way that still
          felt good while also respecting others’ wishes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Early on, I also didn’t feel like I had the ‘right’ to create tickets.
          One of my peers who empowered me to do so was Andres Sanchez. He
          showed me the appropriate place where I could keep these tickets so
          they would eventually get addressed without causing too much noise for
          those who used the project boards. This allowed me to document certain
          issues and add details related to any accessibility shortcomings (as
          mentioned in the prior section) without my own personal hangup of
          feeling like I was harming any relationships by doing so.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Kevin Ball became my new manager in late March, accessibility was
          more accepted. However, despite this, I wasn’t satisfied with where it
          was at and I felt like we could do much more. When I had talked about
          wanting to just go ahead and address some short accessibility tickets
          (such as setting the language and titling pages) but also was worried
          about project deadlines, he came up with a solution where new
          engineers could work on these tickets. This served two purposes: it
          helped them get familiarized with the code base while also allowing me
          to focus on project work. When I lamented how accessibility wasn’t
          officially part of the process, he encouraged me to talk to our
          product manager to ask if we could add that and to write up how to
          carry out the manual tests. He also helped make it a norm by including
          it in the QA template.
        </p>

        <p>
          When discussing strategies for making the newest feature accessible
          with an engineer-turned-manager, Matte Bailey, he introduced to me the
          idea of the Pit of Success: “A well-designed system makes it easy to
          do the right things and annoying (but not impossible) to do the wrong
          things”. For me, this meant having:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            A team that is trained to recognize different needs and can create a
            product that accommodates everyone
          </li>

          <li>
            Testing and tools in place that can catch accessibility issues.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          As a direct result of this talk, we were able to move the needle for
          both of these areas. Matte was able to coordinate a series of meetings
          with his team and me so they could learn some techniques and
          information for building a feature usable by truly anyone. This also
          spurred me to finish actually further configuring and enabling the
          eslint-plugin-a11y-jsx, a small piece of #2 that I had been putting
          off for a while.
        </p>

        <aside>
          <details>
            <summary>Surrounding context around this discussion</summary>
            Accessibility at Humu had a huge win in late spring of 2022 when our
            VP of Product, Will Doolittle, required that our newest feature be
            WCAG A compliant. During this team, Matte Bailey was one of the
            leads of this team (while I was on a different one) and I had a
            catch-up meeting.

        <p>
          Even when you are trying to make a large change in an organization, it
          is still beneficial to work within its norms. You will always get
          further working with your coworkers than working against them. Your
          individual experience will differ, but the advice you receive will be
          just as valuable.

        <h2>Share the Load</h2>

        <p>
          In time, you may find that your responsibilities and what you want to
          accomplish for accessibility exceed your capacity. When this happens,
          you can consider sharing the load in order to protect your mental
          health, continue doing what is right, and also highlight the other
          experts on your team.
        </p>

        <aside>
          <details>
            <summary>Personal context</summary>
            This particular piece is incredibly dependent on your particular
            situation. At Humu there was no official accessibility lead, team,
            committee, or anything like that, so any work towards that had to be
            balanced with project work and team responsibilities. Since this was
            something that I was particularly passionate about and no one else
            was owning it on the engineering side when I first joined and the
            other champions had left months before I joined, I went ahead and
            created a general engineering strategy for accessibility, tickets,
            and documentation. That led to others also asking me questions,
            which eventually led to carving out time in my schedule to ensure
            that the engineering side of Humu had some general direction
            regarding accessibility.
          </details>
        </aside>

        <p>
          As part of trying to disseminate accessibility knowledge, I had
          dedicated accessibility office hours multiple days a week so it would
          be more convenient and consistent for others to find time to talk with
          me. Unfortunately, in September I had some health issues on top of
          having more responsibilities. This meant I had to make some difficult
          decisions in different parts of my life to create more balance. One
          decision was cutting down my office hours to fewer hours each week.
          Luckily, by this time we had hired two other engineers who also had
          accessibility expertise, Vincent Colavin and Jason Featheringham, who
          thankfully agreed to join me in hosting office hours. Not only did
          this give me some breathing room, but this signaled that Vincent and
          Jason were knowledgeable in this area as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I found a new job and put in my resignation notice at Humu, I
          didn’t want the documentation or progress to be lost. At this point in
          time, Diana Viglucci, an engineer on Matte and Kat’s team, had shown a
          lot of leadership and passion in Humu’s accessibility efforts. They
          were an easy choice to entrust ownership of the accessibility drive
          and other responsibilities I had taken on in the last year. It was no
          small set of responsibilities, but still, they generously accepted.
        </p>

        <aside>
          <details>
            <summary>This was a lot!</summary>
            They took on addressing the next items in the accessibility plan
            documents, updating the general and semantic presentations, taking
            ownership of the tickets, and making sure the accessibility portion
            of the bug bash document was up-to-date, among other things.
          </details>
        </aside>
        <p>
          For me, it is particularly hard to ask people for help. However, when
          it’s for something as crucial as making sure every user has the
          ability to use our app, it became much easier. It’s also important to
          remember that something as broad and encompassing as making your
          product accessible cannot be a one-person thing, especially when there
          is no specific role for it.
        </p>

        <aside>
          <details>
            <summary>Even more personal context</summary>
            Feeling bad about asking people for things was another more personal
            hang-up that I had, and it was partially because I had been an
            accessibility lead at the previous place I worked at. When I had
            that title, I felt like I had more of a go-ahead to do certain
            things (including making an accessibility committee) that I no
            longer felt like I had the right to do without that title at Humu.
            Since nothing here was official, it felt like I was imposing on
            people by asking for things.

        <h2>Share Recognition</h2>

        <p>
          Finally, I recommend recognizing the efforts of others who have
          contributed to making the product more inclusive.
        </p>

        <p>
          First off, it’s simply the polite thing to do! It can be very tiring
          and uncomfortable speaking up for what you believe in, especially when
          it initially seems like you have an unpopular opinion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Secondly, it’s important to recognize that you’re in this together
          with others who also care about inclusivity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, movements that are started by a small group may seem
          exclusive at first. Recognizing others helps the members of the
          broader group (particularly ones that are shyer) realize they can join
          the effort at any point in time and allows everyone to feel more
          ownership over the results.
        </p>

        <p>
          You might have noticed that I named a lot of names during this post.
          I’ll say it again: accessibility, especially when there is no initial
          buy-in or official role for it, cannot be achieved from the actions of
          a single person. Things don’t magically just happen: there is a
          conscious choice and effort behind every action. Although I was
          recognized by my peers and colleagues for my work in accessibility at
          Humu, it truly was a team effort and I want to recognize the other
          accessibility advocates at Humu who shared their time and energy.
          Without them, the processes and capabilities for making Humu’s
          products accessible wouldn’t be where it is today.

          <h3>Cheers for Peers</h3>

          <p>
            That said, I’m not done shouting people out. There are both more
            people I want to honor, and people I want to honor more:
          </p>

          <p>
            Autumn Coyle, the senior designer at Humu, who was and is still an
            invaluable advocate. She cared deeply about accessibility, and it
            was apparent even to me as a person who never worked on a feature
            project with her. She always promptly and thoughtfully answer any
            questions I had on her desired keyboard and screenreader flows. She
            also organized a monthly design and engineering collaboration
            session. Autumn and I would share with each other our findings on
            some global components that we had in our system, the pattern it
            most resembled, and how to make it more inclusive for all. The
            results of these meetings were decision documents and detailed
            tickets.
          </p>

          <p>
            Andres Sanchez (again), who on top of calling out every
            accessibility issue he found (and fixing many of them) and creating
            the #a11y Slack channel at Humu, also had an amazing ability to
            identify opportunities for us to work on and promote accessibility
            items. Just one example of this is when we had an internal tools
            hackathon in early 2022 (potentially even before then). There were
            already suggestions of what to work on but making the product more
            accessible was not one of them. He immediately suggested that we
            team up and work on that, and also spread the word regarding this
            work at Humu’s recurring Demo Day (a meeting where people would
            share what they had been working on).
          </p>

          <p>
            Trevor Biller and Michael An, two engineers who encouraged my
            accessibility feedback when I had felt most discouraged. This meant
            a lot to me as it was after the time that I had been publicly told
            that accessibility was not a priority. This had given me the signal
            that Humu’s values and my values did not align. When they expressed
            that they found these reviews useful, it showed me that there were
            others who cared about inclusivity and equity. If not for their
            comments, I might have eventually returned to my previous company
            and the engineering side of this work would not have been done, or
            at least until Vincent joined in March, which leads us to…
          </p>

          <p>
            Vincent Colavin (again), who in addition to hosting office hours,
            configured our Ladle (a component library/playground) to show
            accessibility errors in our components so we could address them
            earlier in the development process. Efrain Ferrer, a designer who
            volunteered to become an office hour host when I first announced
            that Vincent and Jason were joining the office hours roster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sophie Alpert, the VP of Engineering, for many reasons. She gave me
            tons of advice, like sharing a bit of the history of accessibility
            at Humu, refining my strategy on choosing which pages we should
            focus on auditing first, and also suggesting practices that fell
            within the norms of Humu, as well as being another resource for
            accessibility. She also cultivated and maintained a culture where
            sharing information was easy and expected. It was incredibly easy
            getting the first accessibility presentation on the engineering
            team’s calendar because of how we would essentially have biweekly
            lunch-and-learns. I have difficulty asking for things so this was
            one less stressor in my life.
          </p>

          <p>
            Diana Viglucci, who I already mentioned as being the current steward
            of the accessibility documents and strategy. I also wanted to
            highlight their contributions before that. For context, most of the
            engineers who had prior accessibility experience were on a different
            team (Vincent, Jason, and myself with Kevin as our manager). Diana
            became their team’s accessibility expert, and it was exciting not
            just seeing the accessibility work they were doing via their pull
            requests, but also hearing about the presentations they were giving
            on the work that has been done for their team’s newest features.
          </p>

          <p>
            Eric Robinson, who eventually became my team’s product manager and
            made certain process changes frictionless. I am so used to hearing
            no, that the thought of asking to do things cause me more stress
            than actually doing the thing. This is why I am so grateful to Eric
            for breezily saying yes when I wanted to introduce processes related
            to accessibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            Will Doolittle, who made a requirement that the latest features
            needed to meet WCAG A compliance. This was a huge win and finally
            solidified accessibility as a priority at Humu.
          </p>

          <p>
            Miriam Connor, who also encouraged and supported my mission in
            public and private settings, and always advocated doing the right
            thing when the topic of speed versus equity for all came up.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kevin Ball (again), who helped me in a lot of ways beyond what I had
            mentioned in the earlier sections. He always had a way of finding
            exactly who to also best talk to about certain situations, presented
            the perfect frameworks for different issues, and offered me a wealth
            of valuable insights.
          </p>

          <p>
            And again, anyone who ever called out any sort of accessibility
            issue or asked or answered clarifying questions on accessibility.
            This includes essentially everyone who has been mentioned so far,
            but I am sure there were more.
          </p>

          <p>
            I do want to also thank two people whose work or influence I would
            come across though our times at Humu never overlapped. The first
            person is Robbie Tillieard, who created an accessibility goal
            document, which gave me an idea of where Humu was in terms of
            vision. The second person is Carlos Lopez, an engineer who left
            about a year before I joined. Most of the time I was pleasantly
            surprised by something in the code base (usually even the presence
            and correct usage of ARIA attributes), it was Carlos’s doing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, I would not have been able to play the part I did when
            working at Humu without the support I had received at the place I
            worked prior, Hello Alice. Thank you, Jillian Fortin, my mentor in
            accessibility, and Kelsey Ruger, my previous boss who gave me the
            resources, space, and confidence to learn and apply those learnings.

        <h2>In Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
          When I first started drafting this post about my time as an
          accessibility advocate at Humu, I wanted to write about how to create
          a bottoms-up accessibility movement. However, as I went through what I
          did, I realized that a lot of the changes on the engineering side were
          straightforward ones and have been already covered by other experts.
          What isn’t as widely or deeply covered is just how much of a group
          effort this is.
        </p>

        <p>
          It also made me realize: People make up an organization and decide
          what is important. While we didn’t have any official roles or
          programs, when people care about something and work towards it, it
          shows through the improvements made. So even if accessibility doesn’t
          start off as something that people explicitly say they care about, on
          your journey to making things accessible you may find that sentiment
          can change. In the meantime, there is no shortage of things that you
          can do to help make your team create more accessible products.

        <h2>Further Acknowledgments</h2>

        <p>
          I know what you’re thinking… “Karrie wants to give even more thanks?!”
          Yes, I do!
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you to Kevin Ball and Tim Lu for looking at my initial drafts.
          They were truly rough in every sense of the word.
        </p>

        <p>Thank you to Autumn Coyle for looking at the semi-final draft.</p>

        <p>
          While we are at it: Thank you, Blake Parkinson and Trisha Mittal. I
          don’t think I’d have the right to even write this post at all if my
          current team wasn’t as good at inclusivity and creating accessible
          features as it is!
        </p>

        <p>
          And thank you, reader, for making it through this post. Good luck on
          your own journey to making your organization and its products more
          inclusive.
